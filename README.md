## 1. Overview of Project
  This project used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language to create flexible and interactive macros to run analyses on multiple stocks.
  
  The results of the analyses provide insights on the trading volume and the performance of a green energy stock, DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) and will guide decisions on how to diversify the green energy stock portfolio. The analyses will also provide information on the cost of running the VBA automated scripts. The analyses were performed using the Stock_analysis dataset

In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
### i. Objective
To explore green energy stock performance by analyzing financial data using VBA and to refactor codes to make the VBA scripts run faster.

### ii. Methods and Software
